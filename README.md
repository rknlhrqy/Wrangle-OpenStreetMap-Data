# Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data
It has all the documents and codes I prepared to finish the project

Here are the list of the documents:
1, Project_Description.html:  the Project report. I did not convert it to PDF, because I feel HTML is more easy to read.
2, Lesson_6: folder which holds all the Python codes for lesson 6 quizzes.
3, san_jose_ca.txt: A text file containing a link to the map position you wrangled in your project, a short description of the area and a reason for your choice.
4, san-jose_california_sample.osm: An .osm file containing a sample part of the map region I used.
5, san-jose_california_sample.osm.json: An JSON file generated from san_jose-california_sample.osm using python code "data.py".
6, resources.txt: A text file containing a list of Web sites, and github repositories that I referred to or used in this submission
7, san-jose_california.osm.bz2: The downloaded San Jose OSM XML map file is added. It is downloaded from https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/.
8, Project: folder which holds all the Python codes I developed for this project.
