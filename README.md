# Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data
It has all the documents and codes I prepared to finish the project

Here are the list of the documents:
1, Project_Description.html:  the Project report. I did not convert it to PDF, because I feel HTML is more easy to read.
2, Lesson_6: folder which holds all the Python codes for lesson 6 quizzes.
3, san_jose_ca.txt: A text file containing a link to the map position you wrangled in your project, a short description of the area and a reason for your choice.
4, san_jose-california_sample.osm: An .osm file containing a sample part of the map region I used.
5, resources.txt: A text file containing a list of Web sites, and github repositories that I referred to or used in this submission
